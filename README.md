# üöñ OLA Ride Data Analytics Project

**Author: Monica Shree**

**Internship Project ‚Äî 2025**

## üìå Overview
The OLA Ride Analytics Project aims to analyze customer ride behavior, vehicle usage, revenue streams, cancellations, and ratings.

We leveraged:

SQLite database (for structured storage and querying).

SQL queries (for extracting KPIs).

Power BI dashboards (for business-focused visualization).

Streamlit dashboard (for interactive analytics & deployment).

The goal was to provide data-driven insights for OLA‚Äôs operations, cancellations, and customer satisfaction.

## **1. Problem Statement**
The rise of ride-sharing platforms has transformed urban mobility. OLA generates vast amounts of data related to ride bookings, driver availability, fare calculations, and customer preferences. The challenge is to convert this data into actionable insights to improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and business strategies.

---

## **2. Business Use Cases**
- Identify peak demand hours and optimize driver allocation.
- Analyze customer behavior for personalized marketing strategies.
- Understand pricing patterns and surge pricing effectiveness.
- Detect anomalies or fraudulent activities in ride data.

---

## **3. Dataset**
- File: `dataset/OLA_Dataset.xlsx`
- Contains columns such as booking_id, booking_datetime, booking_status, vehicle_type, ride_distance, booking_value, driver_ratings, customer_rating, payment_method, and derived flags (success, cancelled_by_customer, cancelled_by_driver).

---


## **4. Project Approach**

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values and incorrect formats.
   - Validate numeric ranges (ratings 0‚Äì5, distances positive).
   - Remove duplicates and check primary key (`booking_id`).
   - Added derived columns for:
     - `successful_ride` (1 if ride completed)
     - `cancelled_by_customer` (1 if cancelled by customer)
     - `cancelled_by_driver` (1 if cancelled by driver)

2. **SQL Database (SQLite)**
   - Imported cleaned Excel as CSV into SQLite.
   - Fixed datatypes for:
     - `booking_id` ‚Üí INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
     - `driver_ratings` ‚Üí REAL
   - Wrote queries to extract insights: successful rides, average distances, cancellations, top customers, revenue, ratings.

3. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Visualized key metrics:
     - Overall: Ride Volume Over Time, Booking Status Breakdown
     - Vehicle Type: Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance, Avg Customer Ratings
     - Revenue: Revenue by Payment Method, Top 5 Customers, Ride Distance Distribution
     - Cancellations: Reasons for cancelled rides
     - Ratings: Driver Ratings Distribution, Customer vs Driver Ratings

4. **Streamlit Application**
   - Interactive dashboard replicating Power BI visuals.
   - Sidebar for navigation: Overall, Vehicle Type, Revenue, Cancellation, Ratings.
   - SQL queries fetch live data from SQLite DB.
   - Plots: line charts, bar charts, pie charts using Plotly.

  AND driver_ratings GLOB '[0-9]*';
  
-- **7. Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI**:-

SELECT *

SELECT 
    SUM(CAST(booking_value AS REAL)) AS total_success_booking_value

FROM OLA_DataSet

  AND booking_value GLOB '[0-9]*';

-- **10. List all incomplete rides along with the reason**:-

SELECT 
    booking_id,

## 6. Business Insights

- ‚úÖ Peak Ride Days: Ride demand is highest on weekends.
- ‚úÖ Popular Vehicles: Sedans & SUVs contribute highest ride distances.
- ‚úÖ Payment Preference: Digital methods (UPI & Wallet) dominate over cash.
- ‚úÖ Customer Loyalty: A few top customers account for significant revenue share.
- ‚úÖ Cancellations: More cancellations are customer-driven (location issues, change of plan).
- ‚úÖ Ratings Gap: Customers tend to rate drivers slightly lower than drivers rate customers.

---

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL + Power BI + Streamlit can provide a complete end-to-end analytics solution:

SQL ‚Üí clean, structured data for KPIs.

Power BI ‚Üí executive-level dashboards.
