# OLA-Internship-Project
This project is a ** OLA Analytics Dashboard** developed during my Data Analyst internship at OLA.   It provides insights into ride statistics, driver performance, and booking trends using **Python, Streamlit, and SQLite**. The dashboard allows users to explore **key metrics and trends** across different cities, dates, and ride types.
